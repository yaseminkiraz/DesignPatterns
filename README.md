# DesignPatterns

# A.Creational Design Patterns
 1. Factory:Creates an instance of several derived classes
 2. Abstract Factory:Creates an instance of several families of classes
 3. Singleton:A class of which only a single instance can exist
 4. Builder:Separates object construction from its representation
 5. Prototype:A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
 6. Object Pool


# B.Structural Design Patterns
 7. Decorator: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
 8. Adapter:	Match interfaces of different classes
 9. Facade: A single class that represents an entire subsystem
 10. Bridge: Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
 11. Composite: A tree structure of simple and composite objects
 12. Flyweight: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
 13. Proxy: An object representing another object

# C.Behavioral Design Patterns
 14. Chain of Responsibility: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
 15. Command: Encapsulate a command request as an object
 16. Interpreter: A way to include language elements in a program
 17. Mediator:	Defines simplified communication between classes
 18. Memento: Capture and restore an object's internal state
 19. Observer: A way of notifying change to a number of classes
 20. State:	Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
 21. Strategy: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
 22. Template Method: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
 23. Iterator: Sequentially access the elements of a collection
 24. Visitor: Defines a new operation to a class without change
